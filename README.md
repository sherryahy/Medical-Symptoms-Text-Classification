# Medical-Symptoms-Text-Classification
With more and more people seeking online medical service during the Covid-19 pandemic, the adoption of natural language processing and machine learning techniques have become a rising interest in the healthcare industry. Our project aims to help with the automation of the initial classification of medical symptoms, which will greatly save time in matching patients with the correct doctors. Thus, we propose a text classification project that finds the best combination of textual feature extraction methods and multi-class classification algorithms that can be used to classify the ailments based on some phrases the patients entered.
# Dataset
We use a medical dataset from Kaggle which consists of 6,661entries, 13 columns and generated by different contributors describing their medical symptoms. The entries have a text phrase describing the symptom and the text phrases are labeled with ailments the text phrases correspond to.
